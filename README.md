# GLFWE

a small wrapper for glfw3 written in c++. in development and being used for a variety of my own projects.

## Wrappers
- windows
- shaders / programs
- textures
- buffers
- vertex arrays
- Wrapper for string display
- drawing simple shapes - rectangles & lines

## In progress
- improve string wrapper to use only a single texture
- more simple shapes drawing

## Issues
